# JASP Hackathon: Build your own module
8-9 December 2025
Netherlands eScience Center, Amsterdam
## What is JASP?
[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) is a **popular**, **free** and **open source** software for conducting and teaching **statistics**.

You can think of it as a free alternative to SPSS; or as a point-and-click, less intimidating alternative to R.

Worldwide, [over 290 universities across 67 different countries](https://jasp-stats.org/world-map/) have informed us that they use JASP in their curricula. Most importantly perhaps, students and teachers report finding JASP insightful and pleasant to use.
### What is a JASP module?
JASP provides a number of modules that expand its functionality. In addition, it allows users to write and submit their own modules, so the whole user community can benefit their collective expertise.

Under the hood, all JASP modules are based on R packages. You can think of a JASP module as an R package with a graphical interface on top of it.

## What are we going to do in this hackathon?
The attendants will bring their own idea for a module.
Our experienced JASP developers will guide them through the whole process to turn it into a working JASP module.

In the process we'll learn not only about JASP and R, but also about graphical user interfaces and the Qt language.
